# TouchDocs

A open source web app for displaying programming language and framework documentation in a touch device-friendly manner.

## Requirements

Undefined at this point. If a server-side component is necessary (it probably will be), a lightweight **PHP-based** RESTful API seems like a good idea.

An object DB like CouchDB or MongoDB would probably lend itself to this. Possibly consider an abstraction layer like Lawnchair, though.
